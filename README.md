# Compiler Optimization Notes

## How to add material

1. If you want to add material for lecture module N, look for the file moduleN.tex and add to it. If the file does not exist, create it.
2. Look at main.tex and ensure that the line "\include{../moduleN}" is uncommented.
3. Type make to generate the PDF file to see your added content.

## Schedule

The following assignment indicates the students responsible for
each pair of modules.  If a student is responsible for a module, he/she
needs to prepare scribe notes for that module _and_ present a summary
for those modules during that week's interaction session.  The students
also need to record the salient points of discussion during the discussion
session related to those modules (they should create an additional section at the
end of that group of modules called "Discussion on Modules MM-NN").
